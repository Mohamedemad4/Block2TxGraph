Block2TxGraph

script now saves PWD is now blocks but it saves file genrated by generate_graph() in ../
I have documented how to set a timeout for requests.get do look at it
the imp. is not clean but it works fast and it is efficient 
once a child is dispatched it cannot be killed 
and it has only copies of gloabl vars and not the actual ones (read line 121 for more info)
